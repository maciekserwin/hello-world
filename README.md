# hello-world
My first repository
> **I decided to change my life and start coding**
---
*But why*
---
1. In my previous job, I have already achieved everything I would like to achieve.
2. I am tired of working in the field.
3. I want to try something new.
4. I want to get new skills.
---
==Here is my plan to do something==
---
- [x] Start the course.
- [ ] Learn a lot.
- [ ] Pass the final test.
- [ ] Find a new job.
- [ ] Be happy again.

*Will I succeed and be able to check all the above boxes?*

I'll be back in a few months and check it out. Everything in my hands! :joy:
